What Would Make Next Time 1% Better
---
Becoming more familiar with the coding terms and symbols and what they mean
* Focus: We were focused the whole time

* Communication: I just need to specify if there are capital letters or spaces more often to reduce confusion.

* Pacing: Pacing was as fast as it could go with my current coding knowledge so becoming more familiar with the terms would help me become faster paced.

* Division of responsibility: Divided well. Able to stick to roles of driver and navigator

* Code quality: The code worked so Id say the quality is good.
