from math import sin, cos, pi

angle = pi / 4
unit_value = sin(angle)**2 + cos(angle)**2

print(f'sin^2({angle:.3f}) + cos^2({angle:.3f}) = {unit_value:.3f}')

# This is the corrected version. Needed ot as pi as a math import and needed to change UNIT_VALUE to the lowercase version.
# I used copilot for help
