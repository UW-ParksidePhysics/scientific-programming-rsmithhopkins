# the corrected code is as follows
initial_velocity = 3  # m/s
time = 1  # s
acceleration = 2  # m/s**2

displacement = initial_velocity * time + 0.5 * acceleration * time**2

print(f's(t = {time:.0f} s) = {displacement:.1f} m')
# I had to change a comma to a decimal in 0,5. I had to remove the units from the end of the numbers and make them a comment instead.
# Had to change periods to asterisks in multiplication.
# Changed letters to names form varialbles
